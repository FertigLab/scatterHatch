Description: The objective of this package is to efficiently create scatterplots
             where groups can be distinguished by color and texture.
             Visualizations in computational biology tend to have many groups
             making it difficult to distinguish between groups solely on color.
             Thus, this package is useful for increasing the accessibility of
             scatterplot visualizations to those with visual impairments such as
             color blindness.
